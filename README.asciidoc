= Repour - Archival Code Service

Repour archives source code from many untrusted origins into trusted git repositories. It supports SCMs like link:https://git-scm.com/[git], link:https://www.mercurial-scm.org/[hg], and link:https://subversion.apache.org/[svn], as well as archive formats link:http://www.libarchive.org/[like tar and zip]. Tools like link:https://github.com/release-engineering/pom-manipulation-ext[PME] can optionally be applied as ``adjust``ments, and the results archived alongside the unmodified sources.

Why the name "Repour"? First, it contains the common short word for "repository" ("repo"); second, the action of "repouring" could be used to describe what the program does to the repositories.

== Ethos

_Repour *is not* a source repository mirroring service_, it archives source code for builds. This may sound the same but there is a big difference. Repour solves an entire class of problems surrounding the unreliability of "SCM coordinates" (a SCM url and commit/reference/revision), _that a mirror is not able to solve_.

=== Mirrors are flawed

A mirror can only be an exact copy of the upstream repository. Critically, any modifications to existing objects must be propagated, or the mirror ceases to be a mirror. If the upstream repository is not history protected, then neither the upstream repository or the mirror are suitable to build from. If the upstream repository is history protected, then there is no need for a mirror (except to ensure server availability). However, since virtually all upstreams are not history protected, or only weakly protected, a different solution is required.

=== The single requirement

How can the mutability conflict be handled if a mirror can't solve it? Strip everything back to the minimum required and go from there.

The only firm requirement of storing source code for builds is that the same coordinates, point to the same tree of files, forever. Everything else is a nice-to-have, including the upstream history.

== Repour as part of a build system

This section describes how Repour is intended to be employed within the collection of services that form a build system.

=== What Repour will do and not do

Repour does not mirror or in any way store more from the origins than the files that are required to build from. In exchange Repour provides these guarantees:

==== Coordinate Immutability

The git URL and tag Repour returns will always be valid, and will always point to the same file tree. This is an important part of ensuring builds can be reproduced.

==== File Tree Deduplication

For the same `name` and file tree, the same tag will be returned, as was returned the first time the tree was seen. This can be used to avoid rebuilding the same sources.

==== No Conflict Intervention

The overall design means there are no history conflicts, so manual intervention is never required to archive sources. This is an important part of a highly automated build system.

=== What the repository provider must do and not do

Repour needs a git repository provider that grants it the following permissions:

- Create repositories
- Clone repositories
- Push new tags
- Push commits to new branches
- Push fast-forward commits to existing branches

Also, the repository provider _must not_ grant the following permissions to Repour and all other users:

- Delete repositories
- Push non-fast-forward commits
- Push existing tags (re-tagging)
- Push non-fast-forward commits (force push)

In this configuration, commits and tags are immutable in the repository, i.e. link:#coordinate-immutability[history is protected].

=== What the rest of the build system must do and not do

Since Repour is probably not exposed at the edge of the build system, other parts will have access to the raw SCM coordinates before Repour processes them. For the vast majority of cases, the rest of the build system should not attempt to interpret the raw SCM coordinates. The coordinates should be merely passed along, so there is no duplication of effort, or bad assumptions made about mutability.

Once Repour is called, it returns a set of git coordinates that can be used by the rest of the build system. See link:#what-repour-will-do-and-not-do[What Repour will do and not do].

==== Direct clients

Repour `/pull` has a `name` parameter, which impacts which repository the sources end up in. As the logical grouping of sources is beyond the scope of Repour, it is left to the caller to determine. However, unique ``name``s result in unique deduplication namespaces, so if the caller wants to use Repour's link:#file-tree-deduplication[deduplication guarantee] optimally, a minimal set of ``name``s should be used.

Repour would be perfectly happy if it were given the same `name` for every request (regardless of how related the sources are), so lean towards too few unique names rather than too many.

==== Builder clients

When a builder host gets the sources, it won't communicate with Repour, but with the git repository provider where Repour has stored the sources.

The builder should not assume there is a default branch (`master` for example) in the repository, there won't be one there, as the repository is a collection of orphan branches.

Repour specifically returns a tag instead of a commit ID so the builder can perform a fast shallow clone. Cloning the full repository is of no benefit to the build, as it uses only the single file tree. Also, the full clone time will grow linearly with the number of unique file trees stored in the repository. This is the recommended git command to use:

[source,bash]
----
git clone --depth 1 --branch $tag $readonlyurl
----

Note that `--branch` is only usable with references (tags or branches), not commit IDs. The builder typically should not clone from a branch name as this is inherently mutable.

== Docker Images and Open Shift

There are two docker images defined in this repository:

1. ``Dockerfile``, the main image containing the Repour server.
2. ``Dockerfile.gitolite``, a default repository provider image. Mostly intended for testing or non-critical production use.

The docker images can be run in plain Docker or OpenShift. Some less-than-ideal design choices were made to fit the applications into the OSE-compatible containers:

* `pid1.py` is the entrypoint of both images, and remains running for the life of the container. It works around the "Docker PID1 Zombie Problem" by reaping adopted children in addition to the primary child defined by its arguments.
* `au.py` runs second in both images, but finishes with an exec call, so it doesn't remain running. It detects if the container UID has been forced to a non-existing user (as OpenShift does). If so, it activates `nss_wrapper` so git and ssh can continue to operate.
* `gitolite_et_al.py` runs third in `Dockerfile.gitolite` only, it configures and starts the three processes required for gitolite.
** The HTTP and SSH servers can't be split into seperate images because OSE does not allow containers to share persistent volumes
** The lack of shared persistent volumes in OSE also means the container is not scalable
** The third process in the container is tail, it reads the gitolite log so OSE can see it on the container stdout.
** The configuration can't be included in the image because the working directory is intended to be the persistent volume mount, which will start empty in OSE.

=== Locally Simulated OSE

The integration tests use the Docker images in an OSE-like environment. To do something similar yourself, you first need a volume mount that is structured the same as an OpenShift `Secret` volume would be:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p /tmp/secrets/repour /tmp/secrets/admin
ssh-keygen -f /tmp/secrets/repour/repour -N ""
ssh-keygen -f /tmp/secrets/admin/admin -N ""
----

Note the real `Secret` volume could actually be multiple volumes (mounted at `/mnt/secrets/repour` and `/mnt/secrets/admin`), so least privilege can apply. `Dockerfile.gitolite` only needs to know the public keys of both users, and `Dockerfile` only needs to know the private key of the `repour` user. Neither needs to know the `admin` user's private key.

Then start both images, mounting the volume as shared. `Dockerfile` needs some environment variables: where to find the repository provider, and a REST endpoint required by PME (provide a dummy value if not using adjust)

[source,bash]
----
docker run --volume "/tmp/secrets:/mnt/secrets:z" --user="$UID" -d --name repour_git repour_integration_test_git:latest
docker run --volume "/tmp/secrets:/mnt/secrets:z" --user="$UID" -d --link repour_git:git --name repour -e "REPOUR_GITOLITE_HOST=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' repour_git)" -e "REPOUR_PME_DA_URL=foo" repour_integration_test:latest

== Development

=== Local Server Setup

==== Prerequisites

- Python 3.4.1+
- pip
- Git 2.4.3+
- Mercural (optional, for hg support)
- Subversion (optional, for svn support)
- Docker 1.7.1+ (optional, for integration tests)

==== Setup the virtual environment with vex

1. Install vex for the current user with `pip3 install --user vex`
2. Ensure `$PATH` includes `$HOME/.local/bin`
3. Install the required C libraries with system package manager. On Fedora: `dnf install python3-devel python3-Cython libyaml-devel`
4. `vex -m --python python3.4 rpo pip install -r venv/runtime.txt`
5. Optionally: `vex rpo pip install -r venv/integration-test.txt`

===== Recreating the virtual environment

1. Delete the old environment with `vex -r rpo true`
2. Rerun the `vex` `pip install` commands

==== Configure

Copy the example configuration in `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml`, then edit.

==== Start the server

[source,bash]
vex rpo python -m repour run

For more information, add the `-h` switch to the command.

=== Tests

==== Unit Tests

Unit tests are self-contained and work without an internet connection. To run them:

1. `vex rpo python -m unittest`

==== Integration Tests

GitLab integration tests will be executed using the local Docker server. To run them:

1. ensure your vex environment includes `venv/integration-test.txt`
2. prefix `REPOUR_RUN_IT=1` before the `unittest` command, to set the triggering environment variable. For example: `REPOUR_RUN_IT=1 vex rpo python -m unittest`
