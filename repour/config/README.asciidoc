= Repour - Configuration Options

=== Where to put the configuration files?

There are two options:

 - Providing an absolute path to the configuration file in an environment variable. Name of the variable is listed
   as a constant in `repor/config/config.py` file.
   To use the variable inside Docker container, you can add it to the `sudo` command in the `script/repour-run.sh`.
 - If the above file is not found, the default configuration file `repour/config/default-config.json` is used instead.
   In the future the file from the first option may inherit defaults from this one, but currently it is just used instead.
   You should prefer the first option instead of editing the default file.

=== What is the file's structure?

The file must be a valid JSON document, the extension does not matter.

=== What are the options?

To make it simple, let's define `x/y/../z` as a list x, y, .., z of keys in the sequence of nested JSON objects that have to be traversed in order to get to the required configuration value.

*Authentication/Authorization:*

 - `auth/provider` - name of the selected auth provider. All available providers are listed in `repour/auth/auth.py`. If empty or removed, no provider will be used.
 - For provider `oauth2_jwt`:
     * `auth/oauth2_jwt/public_key` - public key (including the `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and END) to verify token signature.
     * `auth/oauth2_jwt/token_issuer` - this must match the content of `iss` field in the token.

*Adjust:*

 - `adjust/executions` - contains a list of adjust operation names. The names must be defined under `adjust/`
 - For operation `"op"` the value of `adjust/op` is an object with the following keys:
     * `adjust/op/provider` containing the id of the provider of the adjust operation. Adjust specific options are under `adjust/op/`. The currently supported providers are:
         * `noop` - which, as the name suggests, does nothing
         * `process` - executes a given command, provided as a list of executable name and options as would be separated by whitespace using `adjust/op/cmd` key. As an element of this list, you can use `{repo_dir}`, which will be replaced by an absolute path to the source directory. Another option is `adjust/op/outputToLogs`, which, if `true` will forward the stdout of the adjust process to the Repour logs. Default value is `false`.
         * `pme` - uses POM Manipulation Extention CLI. The parameters are `adjust/op/cliJarPathAbsolute`, an absolute path to the PME CLI executable, `adjust/op/defaultParameters`, a list of arguments to the PME in the same format as `adjust/op/cmd`, and `adjust/op/outputToLogs`.

*SCM:*

 - `scm/git` - contains options for the operations involving git client
     * `scm/git/user.name` - holds git commiter name
     * `scm/git/user.email` - holds git commiter email

=== Additional notes

Not all possible configuration options are yet migrated to use this system.
